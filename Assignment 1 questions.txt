What are the considerations you had to include in your operator= function
Make sure there is enough space for all of the characters in the string. Make sure it returns a *this pointer.

What is the similarity and difference between copy constructor and operator= functions
Copy constructor does not return anything. operator= returns a *this pointer. Otherwise, they are the same. Copy constructor makes a new object. Operator= is not envoked unless the object is empty, otherwise it will use the copy constructor.

What steps did you take to ensure no memory leaks?
-Destructors

In terms of big O how long would it take to find an element of this array? How could this be improved? What would the expression become?

O(n)
It could use a binary tree and then it would become O(log n)
